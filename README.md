#### original lyrics: 
可能南方的阳光 照着北方的风
可能时光被吹走 从此无影无踪
可能故事只剩下 一个难忘的人
可能在昨夜梦里 依然笑得纯真
可能北京的后海 许多漂泊的魂
可能成都小酒馆 有群孤独的人
可能枕边有微笑 才能暖你清晨
可能夜空有流星 才能照你前行
可能西安城墙上 有人誓言不分
可能要去到大理 才算爱得认真
可能谁说要陪你 牵手走完一生
可能笑着流出泪 某天在某时辰
可能桂林有渔船 为你迷茫点灯
可能在呼伦草原 牛羊流成风景
可能再也找不到 愿意相信的人
可能穿越了彷徨 脚步才能坚定
可能武当山道上 有人虔诚攀登
可能周庄小巷里 忽然忘掉年轮
可能要多年以后 才能看清曾经
可能在当时身边 有双温柔眼晴
可能西安城墙上 有人誓言不分
可能要去到大理 才算爱得认真
可能谁说要陪你 牵手走完一生
可能笑着流出泪
可能终于有一天 刚好遇见爱情
可能永远在路上 有人奋斗前行
可能一切的可能 相信才有可能
可能拥有过梦想 才能叫做青春

#### English translation
Maybe the sunshine in the south shines upon the wind in the north
Maybe time is blown away, leaving no trace behind
Maybe the story only leaves behind one unforgettable person
Maybe in last night's dream, still laughing with innocence
Maybe in Beijing's Houhai, there are many wandering souls
Maybe in Chengdu's small tavern, there are lonely individuals
Maybe a smile by your pillow can warm your morning
Maybe the night sky has shooting stars to guide your way
Maybe on Xi'an's city wall, someone pledges to never separate
Maybe it takes going to Dali to truly love sincerely
Maybe someone said they would accompany you and walk through a lifetime
Maybe tears flow with a smile at a certain moment in time
Maybe there are fishing boats in Guilin, lighting your way when lost
Maybe on the grasslands of Hulun, cattle and sheep become a scenery
Maybe never again can you find someone willing to believe
Maybe only after wandering can your steps become firm
Maybe on Wudang Mountain's path, someone devoutly climbs
Maybe in the alleys of Zhouzhuang, suddenly forgetting the passing years
Maybe it takes many years to truly understand what once was
Maybe there were gentle eyes beside you at that time
Maybe on Xi'an's city wall, someone pledges to never separate
Maybe it takes going to Dali to truly love sincerely
Maybe someone said they would accompany you and walk through a lifetime
Maybe tears flow with a smile
Maybe one day, you happen to encounter love
Maybe forever on the road, someone struggles and moves forward
Maybe all possibilities rely on belief
Maybe having once had dreams is what defines youth.

烽煙把 霜雪敲落
輕覆過 往日沉屙
你背著光 眸中有星河
我哼著歌 日月應我
沒入眉心的燦爛 被塵埃熄滅又燃
峽天昆侖和彼岸 為誰而撼
滄海 醒過來 多少碑林似山脈
廊燈下 有微詞 窄門亦關不住心懷
生平 苦與難 作談資 指點未來
你我將會同在 一片人海 
以炙熱 得天厚愛
路深處 好夢眷顧
願我 不孤飛 不輕落
與你擦肩的一瞬 有星子被風點燃
燒過文明和霄漢 聲如呐喊
生死 于人寰 有志者幸甚至哉
千秋夢 明月台 除君外無人可完滿
一年 又一年 聚和散 仍有怦然
你我將會同在 一片星海 
以赤誠 閃耀平凡
閃耀平凡

Amidst the flames, frost and snow descend,
Gently covering the days gone by, fading and spent.
You carry the light, with a galaxy in your eyes,
I hum a song, the sun and moon respond to my cries.
The brilliance engraved upon my brow, dimmed and aflame,
Between the Xiatian Kunlun and the other shore, who shall it claim?
Awaken, vast sea, how many monuments akin to mountains,
Beneath the corridor's lamp, whispered words resound like fountains.
Narrow doors cannot contain the aspirations of the heart,
Life's hardships and challenges become our conversation's art.
You and I will be together amidst the ocean of people,
With fervent love and bountiful blessings that are ample.
Deep within the journey, dreams favor our path,
May I not fly alone, nor descend with a light-hearted laugh.
In the fleeting moment as we brush shoulders,
Stars are ignited by the wind, leaving boulders.
We've burned through civilizations and the celestial expanse,
Our voices akin to shouts, in a cosmic dance.
Life and death in this mortal realm, fortunate are those with ambitions,
Eternal dreams on the Moon Terrace, none but you completes my visions.
Year after year, gatherings and partings, still it ignites our hearts,
You and I will be together amidst the stellar expanse, where unity imparts.
With sincerity, we shine in the realm of the ordinary,
Glowing brightly, a beacon in the vast sanctuary.


#### This is Miley's song Flowers translated into Chinese

我们曾经美好，我们曾经辉煌
一种无法出售的梦想
我们曾经正确，直到不再
建造一个家园，看着它燃烧
嗯，我不想离开你
我不想撒谎
开始哭泣，但是我记得
我可以给自己买花
在沙滩上写下我的名字
和自己对话几个小时
说些你无法理解的事情
我可以自己去跳舞
我可以牵着自己的手
是的，我可以比你更好地爱自己
可以更好地爱自己
我可以更好地爱自己，宝贝
可以更好地爱自己
我可以更好地爱自己，宝贝
涂上樱桃红的指甲
与你留下的玫瑰相配
没有懊悔，没有后悔
我原谅你说的每个字
噢，宝贝，我不想离开你
我不想争吵
开始哭泣，但是我记得
我可以给自己买花
在沙滩上写下我的名字
和自己对话几个小时
说些你无法理解的事情
我可以自己去跳舞
我可以牵着自己的手
是的，我可以比你更好地爱自己

### How this works
#### Chat with a lyricsBot to understand a song!
- audio to text: does ai translate songs well? if not, will need to ask user to upload the lyrics  (not convenient enough)  
- llm: prompting (may need fine-tuning too?) to answer lyrics related questions, would be better if music is explanable too
- text/audio to image: when a song is uploaded, some atmospheric image is generated for an immersive ui experience, this could be done by ai too
