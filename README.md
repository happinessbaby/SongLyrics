#### original lyrics: 
可能南方的阳光 照着北方的风
可能时光被吹走 从此无影无踪
可能故事只剩下 一个难忘的人
可能在昨夜梦里 依然笑得纯真
可能北京的后海 许多漂泊的魂
可能成都小酒馆 有群孤独的人
可能枕边有微笑 才能暖你清晨
可能夜空有流星 才能照你前行
可能西安城墙上 有人誓言不分
可能要去到大理 才算爱得认真
可能谁说要陪你 牵手走完一生
可能笑着流出泪 某天在某时辰
可能桂林有渔船 为你迷茫点灯
可能在呼伦草原 牛羊流成风景
可能再也找不到 愿意相信的人
可能穿越了彷徨 脚步才能坚定
可能武当山道上 有人虔诚攀登
可能周庄小巷里 忽然忘掉年轮
可能要多年以后 才能看清曾经
可能在当时身边 有双温柔眼晴
可能西安城墙上 有人誓言不分
可能要去到大理 才算爱得认真
可能谁说要陪你 牵手走完一生
可能笑着流出泪
可能终于有一天 刚好遇见爱情
可能永远在路上 有人奋斗前行
可能一切的可能 相信才有可能
可能拥有过梦想 才能叫做青春

#### English translation
Maybe the sunshine in the south shines upon the wind in the north
Maybe time is blown away, leaving no trace behind
Maybe the story only leaves behind one unforgettable person
Maybe in last night's dream, still laughing with innocence
Maybe in Beijing's Houhai, there are many wandering souls
Maybe in Chengdu's small tavern, there are lonely individuals
Maybe a smile by your pillow can warm your morning
Maybe the night sky has shooting stars to guide your way
Maybe on Xi'an's city wall, someone pledges to never separate
Maybe it takes going to Dali to truly love sincerely
Maybe someone said they would accompany you and walk through a lifetime
Maybe tears flow with a smile at a certain moment in time
Maybe there are fishing boats in Guilin, lighting your way when lost
Maybe on the grasslands of Hulun, cattle and sheep become a scenery
Maybe never again can you find someone willing to believe
Maybe only after wandering can your steps become firm
Maybe on Wudang Mountain's path, someone devoutly climbs
Maybe in the alleys of Zhouzhuang, suddenly forgetting the passing years
Maybe it takes many years to truly understand what once was
Maybe there were gentle eyes beside you at that time
Maybe on Xi'an's city wall, someone pledges to never separate
Maybe it takes going to Dali to truly love sincerely
Maybe someone said they would accompany you and walk through a lifetime
Maybe tears flow with a smile
Maybe one day, you happen to encounter love
Maybe forever on the road, someone struggles and moves forward
Maybe all possibilities rely on belief
Maybe having once had dreams is what defines youth.
